# Style Guide

This documents states almost a dozen rules that I worked with when coding for this project.  
The rules helped me creating 'cleaner' files, codewise, but were also a reminder for consistency in coding and it's conventions.  

Rules:
###Javascript  
1. All the names (for variables and functions) in camelCase [click here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp).
2. Always the use of 2 spaces for indentation of code blocks.
3. Always end a simple statement with a semicolon.
4. Some general rules:
- The opening bracket is always at the end of the first line.
- Always use of one space before the opening bracket.
- The closing bracket on a new line is without leading spaces.
- A complex statement is without a semicolon, like functions.
5. For readability, the line length is not too long.

##HTML
