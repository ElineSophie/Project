On this day, I searched for datamaps for the Netherlands (provinces). I found
something on the internet and tried it with my code.

*Problem*

I could not do it with d3v3 and d3v5. This is a question that I will ask
when a staffmember is available.

On this day, I made the design mark down. Here, I described which visualization will be on each page and i looked for the data that is needed for each visualization.

I also changed my page.

*Problem*

It was really frustrating which kind of visualization is necessary.

Today I collected all data in a csv file. In addition, I started to write a code to write this to a json file (not finished). Looking up all data took a very long time.

What my purpose of the data is that I make all years as a key, ending in a nested dictionary for all years.
