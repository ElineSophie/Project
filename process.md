On this day, I searched for datamaps for the Netherlands (provinces). I found
something on the internet and tried it with my code.

*Problem*

I could not do it with d3v3 and d3v5. This is a question that I will ask
when a staffmember is available.

*Problem*

It was really frustrating which kind of visualization is necessary.
